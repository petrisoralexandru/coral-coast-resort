# Description
An open-source project called **Coral Coast Resort** is dedicated to creating a full management system for a fictive hotel. The project is an MVP (Minimum Viable Product), created to offer a basic solution that enables visitors to reserve a room that's available and finish the check-in procedure.

Users may easily browse and reserve available rooms at Coral Coast Resort thanks to the application's user-friendly and intuitive interface, which will be constructed using ASP.NET Razor Pages for the online site. Additionally, a desktop application in WPF will be created to offer a faster visitor check-in procedure.
